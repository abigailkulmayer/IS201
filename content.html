                        <p>I found myself sitting alone for lunch while Dylan was at work a few weeks ago. We had been in our apartment together just a week at that point, and to say things were looking a little barren is an understatement! Most of you know a thing or two about what I am talking about - moving into a new place, young, just married, hardly owning a dime between the two of you!</p>
                        <p>I learned pretty quickly that focusing on what you don't have is both exhausting and a complete mood-killer. Instead, I looked around to see the little pleasures I found in our new place. The light that comes through the windows on every side. The dark, old wood against white walls. In truth, there is beauty everywhere. I had made some soup for our family and was enjoying some leftovers on our small table with a bouquet of baby's breath flowers. It was the sight of simplicity, and yet I felt that it was strikingly lovely.</p>
                        <p>In the thick of everything, it is wise to slow down and smell the roses.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Homemade Potato Soup</h2>
                        <p>So, here's the star of the show! This soup has been one of my favorites for years. I'm an August birthday - born in the heat of the summer - and yet I recall asking my mom to make this for many a year. The heat couldn't stop me from enjoying this! So, here's the recipe:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Ingredients</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>1 1/2c Onion</li>
                                    <li>1 1/2c Celery</li>
                                    <li>6T Unsalted Butter</li>
                                    <li>3tsp Salt</li>
                                    <li>Dash of Pepper</li>
                                    <li>3 14.5oz Cans Chicken Broth</li>
                                    <li>6c cubed potatoes (about 6-8 potatoes)</li>
                                    <li>4c Milk</li>
                                    <li>1 pint Whipping Cream</li>
                                    <li>3tsp Parsley Flakes</li>
                                    <li>3c Cheddar Cheese</li>
                                </ul>
                            <li>Directions</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>In a soup pot, dice onion and celery and saute√© in butter.</li>
                                    <li>Add salt, pepper and chicken broth and bring to a boil.</li>
                                    <li>Add cubed potatoes, milk, and whipping cream to the pot. You need a big pot for this, we aren't messing around! Bring the heat down to a simmer and stir occasionally while potatoes cook through.</li>
                                    <li>When potaotes are soft, stir in cheese and parsley flakes until creamy.</li>
                                    <li>Enjoy!</li>
                                </ul>
                        </ol>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">A few things I love to add-in or toppings to enjoy: if you like spice, stir in some red pepper flakes when you bring the chicken broth to a boil! Homemade bread - thousand island grilled ham and cheese sandwiches -, bacon bits or avocado are wonderful complements to this dish! Eat whatever brings you joy.</blockquote>
                        <p>I hope you all enjoy this recipe as much as I do! It is the kind of recipe that is delicious and simple on it's own, and yet you can do so many things with it if you put in a little effort! But if you're in more of a relaxed mood and want to just take things as they come, remember to put some flowers on your table, open up the window for some fresh air, and enjoy the wonders of a hearty meal.</p>
